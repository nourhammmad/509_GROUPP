Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory: 

1)EEPROM is used for saving a non-volatile data
like program data or any run time data that must be saved

2)communicate with i2c with its slave address

3)Internally organized with 128 pages of 16 bytes each, the 16K requires
an 11-bit data word address for random word addressing

4)slave address of this device is “1010xxx” xxx ->A0 A1 A2

5)We will work on 24C16 on our course.
 Any EEPROM type has two addresses:
- slave address.
- location address.
-->Slave address will be “1010 xxx” as we mentioned, the
least three significant bits will be used to write the 10th
,9th and 8th bits of locations address, and the remaining
8 bits of location address will be sent at the next byte.
--> We can consider these three bit as the number of page(8 PAGES),
which we will virtually divide the memory into 8 pages,
the number of page will be the value of these three
bits, the size of one page will be 256 Bytes.

6)(write)assume we will write “A” on the 1265 address location:
so the address will be “100 1111 0001”, so the page number will be “100” so the
remaining slave address will be “100”,
let write the frame:
--> write a start condition.
--> write SLA+W “1010 100 0”. (slave address 1010 100 + 0-->write )
--> write remaining location address as a Data “11110001”.(A ascii will be written here)
--> write “A” character “0100 0001”. --> A in ascii (binary)
--> write stop condition

7)(read)assume we will read from the 1265 address location:
so the address will be “100 1111 0001”, so the page number will be “100” so the
remaining slave address will be “100”,
let write the frame:
--> write a start condition.
--> write SLA+W “1010 100 0”.
--> write remaining location address as a Data “11110001”.
--> send a repeated start condition.
--> write SLA+R “1010 100 1”.
--> read the data from this location.
--> write stop condition.
